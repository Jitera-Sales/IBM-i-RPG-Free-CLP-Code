# IBM i RPG/Free CLP Code
 Demo code in RPG/Free, SQL and CLP for the IBM i
 
More developers are learning about the **IBM i** as a wonderful business platform. ( It was formerly known as the **AS/400**.) 

My intent is to provide real programs that help you learn, or improve your current understanding, and which you can adapt to you needs.

Feel free to provide comments and feedback.

## Copy_Mbrs

Code to be copied into other programs.

## Service_Pgms

Utility support routines that are called from other code.

## SQL_SKELETON

Batch program with SQL embedded in RPGLE. Includes error checking and handling.  There are two versions, one in completely free format and one not free with the D-Specs in fixed format.
