# IBM i RPG/Free CLP Code

Demo code in RPG/Free, SQL and CLP for the IBM i

More developers are learning about the **IBM i** as a wonderful business platform. ( It was formerly known as the **AS/400**.)

My intent is to provide real programs that help you learn, or improve your current understanding, and which you can adapt to you needs.

Feel free to provide comments and feedback.

## Copy_Mbrs

Code to be copied into other programs.

## Service_Pgms

Utility support routines that are called from other code.

## SQL_SKELETON

Batch program with SQL embedded in RPGLE. Includes error checking and handling.  There are two versions, one in completely free format and one not free with the D-Specs in fixed format.

## 5250 Subfile

This is a fully functional modernized 5250 "green screen" Customer Master maintenance and prompting application, with full screen and window displays, modular code, service programs, message files and a sample database.

## BASE36

A service program to add 1 to an alpha-numeric string of any length.
