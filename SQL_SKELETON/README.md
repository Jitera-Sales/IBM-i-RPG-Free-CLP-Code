### SQL_SKELETON

Batch program with SQL embedded in RPGLE. Includes error checking and handling.  Two versions, one in completely free format and one not free with the D-Specs in fixed format.

*SQL_SKEL* is completely free format, i.e., code begins in column 1.

*SQL_SKELNF* is not totally free format, because the D_SPECS are in fixed format.  This should be compatible back to V5R4 I think

You should be able to compile the program without any changes and run it on virtually any IBM i.  I developed it on a V7R4 machine.  If you are at an older release then the not totally free version will progably compile.
